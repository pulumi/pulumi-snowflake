    /// !&gt; **Caution: Preview Feature** This feature is considered a preview feature in the provider, regardless of the state of the resource in Snowflake. We do not guarantee its stability. It will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add the relevant feature name to `PreviewFeaturesEnabled` field in the provider configuration. Please always refer to the Getting Help section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions.
    /// 
    /// !&gt; **Important** Starting from v0.95.0, it is advised to use this resource **only** if users are not managed through terraform. Check more in the migration guide.
    /// 
    /// !&gt; **Warning** This resource shouldn't be used with `snowflake.CurrentAccount` resource in the same configuration, as it may lead to unexpected behavior.
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Snowflake = Pulumi.Snowflake;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var attach = new Snowflake.NetworkPolicyAttachment("attach", new()
    ///     {
    ///         NetworkPolicyName = "policy",
    ///         SetForAccount = false,
    ///         Users = new[]
    ///         {
    ///             "user1",
    ///             "user2",
    ///         },
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult identifiers guide.
    /// &lt;!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods--&gt;
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note** If a field has a default value, it is shown next to the type in the schema.
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import snowflake:index/networkPolicyAttachment:NetworkPolicyAttachment example attachment_policyname
    /// ```
