    /// !&gt; **Caution: Preview Feature** This feature is considered a preview feature in the provider, regardless of the state of the resource in Snowflake. We do not guarantee its stability. It will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add the relevant feature name to `PreviewFeaturesEnabled` field in the provider configuration. Please always refer to the Getting Help section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions.
    /// 
    /// !&gt; **Note** A network rule cannot be dropped successfully if it is currently assigned to a network policy. Currently, the provider does not unassign such objects automatically. Before dropping the resource, first unassign the network rule from the relevant objects. See guide for more details.
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Snowflake = Pulumi.Snowflake;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var rule = new Snowflake.NetworkRule("rule", new()
    ///     {
    ///         Name = "rule",
    ///         Database = "EXAMPLE_DB",
    ///         Schema = "EXAMPLE_SCHEMA",
    ///         Comment = "A rule.",
    ///         Type = "IPV4",
    ///         Mode = "INGRESS",
    ///         ValueLists = new[]
    ///         {
    ///             "192.168.0.100/24",
    ///             "29.254.123.20",
    ///         },
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// &gt; **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult identifiers guide.
    /// &lt;!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods--&gt;
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note** If a field has a default value, it is shown next to the type in the schema.
