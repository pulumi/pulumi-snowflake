    /// &gt; **Note** Read more about PAT support in the provider in our Authentication Methods guide.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note** External changes to `MinsToBypassNetworkPolicyRequirement` are not handled by the provider because the value changes continuously on Snowflake side after setting it.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note** External changes to `DaysToExpiry` are not handled by the provider because Snowflake returns `ExpiresAt` which is the token expiration date. Also, the provider does not handle expired tokens automatically. Please change the value of `DaysToExpiry` to force a new expiration date.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note** External changes to `Token` are not handled by the provider because the data in this field can be updated only when the token is created or rotated.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note** Rotating a token can be done by changing the value of `Keeper` field. See an example below.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Note** In order to authenticate with PAT with role restriction, you need to grant the role to the user. You can use the snowflake.GrantAccountRole resource to do this.
    /// 
    /// Resource used to manage user programmatic access tokens. For more information, check [user programmatic access tokens documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-user-add-programmatic-access-token). A programmatic access token is a token that can be used to authenticate to an endpoint. See [Using programmatic access tokens for authentication](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/programmatic-access-tokens) user guide for more details.
