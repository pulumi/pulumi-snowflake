/**
 * > **Note** Read more about PAT support in the provider in our Authentication Methods guide.
 *
 * > **Note** External changes to `minsToBypassNetworkPolicyRequirement` are not handled by the provider because the value changes continuously on Snowflake side after setting it.
 *
 * > **Note** External changes to `daysToExpiry` are not handled by the provider because Snowflake returns `expiresAt` which is the token expiration date. Also, the provider does not handle expired tokens automatically. Please change the value of `daysToExpiry` to force a new expiration date.
 *
 * > **Note** External changes to `token` are not handled by the provider because the data in this field can be updated only when the token is created or rotated.
 *
 * > **Note** Rotating a token can be done by changing the value of `keeper` field. See an example below.
 *
 * > **Note** In order to authenticate with PAT with role restriction, you need to grant the role to the user. You can use the snowflake.GrantAccountRole resource to do this.
 *
 * Resource used to manage user programmatic access tokens. For more information, check [user programmatic access tokens documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-user-add-programmatic-access-token). A programmatic access token is a token that can be used to authenticate to an endpoint. See [Using programmatic access tokens for authentication](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/programmatic-access-tokens) user guide for more details.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * > **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult identifiers guide.
 * <!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->
