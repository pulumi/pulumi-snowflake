/**
 * > **Note about copy_grants** Fields like `view`, `appendOnly`, `at`, `before`, `showInitialRows` and `stale` can not be ALTERed on Snowflake side (check [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-stream)), and a change on these fields means recreation of the resource. ForceNew can not be used because it does not preserve grants from `copyGrants`. Beware that even though a change is marked as update, the resource is recreated.

 * Resource used to manage streams on views. For more information, check [stream documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-stream).
