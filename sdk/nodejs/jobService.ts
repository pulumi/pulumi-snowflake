/**
 * !> **Caution: Preview Feature** This feature is considered a preview feature in the provider, regardless of the state of the resource in Snowflake. We do not guarantee its stability. It will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add the relevant feature name to `previewFeaturesEnabled` field in the provider configuration. Please always refer to the Getting Help section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions.
 *
 * <!-- TODO(SNOW-2129584): address this limitation -->
 * !> **Caution** Only asynchronous job services are supported. This resource uses `ASYNC=TRUE` during creation. In this case, the command returns immediately while the job is running. Creating a job service automatically executes the job (read more in [EXECUTE JOB SERVICE docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/execute-job-service)).
 *
 * > **Note** For asynchronous jobs, Snowflake does not perform automatic cleanup after completion. You must either remove the resource or execute the `DROP SERVICE` command to remove the job. If you want to execute the job again, use the replace flag.
 *
 * > **Note** During resource deletion and recreation, the provider uses `DROP SERVICE` with `FORCE` option to properly handle services with block storage volumes. Read more in [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/drop-service#force-option).
 *
 * Resource used to manage job services. For more information, check [services documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/execute-job-service). Executes a Snowpark Container Services service as a job. A service, created using `CREATE SERVICE`, is long-running and you must explicitly stop it when it is no longer needed. On the other hand, a job, created using EXECUTE JOB SERVICE (with `ASYNC=TRUE` in this resource), returns immediately while the job is running. See [Working with services](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-services) developer guide for more details.
