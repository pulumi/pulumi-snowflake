/**
 * !> **Caution: Preview Feature** This feature is considered a preview feature in the provider, regardless of the state of the resource in Snowflake. We do not guarantee its stability. It will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add the relevant feature name to `previewFeaturesEnabled` field in the provider configuration. Please always refer to the Getting Help section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions.
 *
 * !> **Note** A network rule cannot be dropped successfully if it is currently assigned to a network policy. Currently, the provider does not unassign such objects automatically. Before dropping the resource, first unassign the network rule from the relevant objects. See guide for more details.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as snowflake from "@pulumi/snowflake";
 *
 * const rule = new snowflake.NetworkRule("rule", {
 *     name: "rule",
 *     database: "EXAMPLE_DB",
 *     schema: "EXAMPLE_SCHEMA",
 *     comment: "A rule.",
 *     type: "IPV4",
 *     mode: "INGRESS",
 *     valueLists: [
 *         "192.168.0.100/24",
 *         "29.254.123.20",
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 * > **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult identifiers guide.
 * <!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->
 *
 * > **Note** If a field has a default value, it is shown next to the type in the schema.
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import snowflake:index/networkRule:NetworkRule example 'databaseName|schemaName|networkRuleName'
 * ```
