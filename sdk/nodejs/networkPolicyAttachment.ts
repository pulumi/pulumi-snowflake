/**
 * !> **Caution: Preview Feature** This feature is considered a preview feature in the provider, regardless of the state of the resource in Snowflake. We do not guarantee its stability. It will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add the relevant feature name to `previewFeaturesEnabled` field in the provider configuration. Please always refer to the Getting Help section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions.
 *
 * !> **Important** Starting from v0.95.0, it is advised to use this resource **only** if users are not managed through terraform. Check more in the migration guide.
 *
 * !> **Warning** This resource shouldn't be used with `snowflake.CurrentAccount` resource in the same configuration, as it may lead to unexpected behavior.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as snowflake from "@pulumi/snowflake";
 *
 * const attach = new snowflake.NetworkPolicyAttachment("attach", {
 *     networkPolicyName: "policy",
 *     setForAccount: false,
 *     users: [
 *         "user1",
 *         "user2",
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * > **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult identifiers guide.
 * <!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->
 *
 * > **Note** If a field has a default value, it is shown next to the type in the schema.
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import snowflake:index/networkPolicyAttachment:NetworkPolicyAttachment example attachment_policyname
 * ```
