/**
 * !> **Caution: Preview Feature** This feature is considered a preview feature in the provider, regardless of the state of the resource in Snowflake. We do not guarantee its stability. It will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add the relevant feature name to `previewFeaturesEnabled` field in the provider configuration. Please always refer to the Getting Help section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as snowflake from "@pulumi/snowflake";
 *
 * const current = snowflake.getAlerts({
 *     database: "MYDB",
 *     schema: "MYSCHEMA",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * > **Note** If a field has a default value, it is shown next to the type in the schema.
