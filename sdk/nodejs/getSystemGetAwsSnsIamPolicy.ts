/**
 * !> **Caution: Preview Feature** This feature is considered a preview feature in the provider, regardless of the state of the resource in Snowflake. We do not guarantee its stability. It will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add the relevant feature name to `previewFeaturesEnabled` field in the provider configuration. Please always refer to the Getting Help section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions.
 *
 * For more details, visit the official Snowflake documentation: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/system_get_aws_sns_iam_policy.
 * Read this guide to understand how to use the snowflake.getSystemGetAwsSnsIamPolicy to integrate with AWS: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-auto-s3#step-1-subscribe-the-snowflake-sqs-queue-to-the-sns-topic.
 * It's SQL-based, but after knowing what has to be done use corresponding resources and data-sources from the Snowflake and AWS Terraform provider.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as snowflake from "@pulumi/snowflake";
 *
 * const snowflakePolicy = snowflake.getSystemGetAwsSnsIamPolicy({
 *     awsSnsTopicArn: "<aws_sns_topic_arn>",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * > **Note** If a field has a default value, it is shown next to the type in the schema.
