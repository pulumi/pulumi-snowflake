/**
 * !> **Caution: Preview Feature** This feature is considered a preview feature in the provider, regardless of the state of the resource in Snowflake. We do not guarantee its stability. It will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add the relevant feature name to `previewFeaturesEnabled` field in the provider configuration. Please always refer to the Getting Help section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions.
 *
 * > **Note** When adding or updating accounts in the `accounts` field, the provider creates a temporary database as a workaround for a Snowflake race condition. This is because accounts cannot be added to a share until after a database has been granted to the share, but database grants depend on the share existing first.
 * The provider automatically:
 * 1. Creates a temporary database (named `TEMP_<share_name>_<timestamp>`)
 * 2. Grants `USAGE` and `REFERENCE_USAGE` privileges on the temporary database to the share
 * 3. Adds the specified accounts to the share
 * 4. Revokes the privileges and drops the temporary database
 *    This process is fully automated during the creation.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * > **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult identifiers guide.
 * <!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as snowflake from "@pulumi/snowflake";
 *
 * const test = new snowflake.Share("test", {
 *     name: "share_name",
 *     comment: "cool comment",
 *     accounts: ["organizationName.accountName"],
 * });
 * const example = new snowflake.Database("example", {name: "test"}, {
 *     dependsOn: [test],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * > **Note** If a field has a default value, it is shown next to the type in the schema.
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import snowflake:index/share:Share example name
 * ```
