/**
 * > **Note** For more details about granting ownership, please visit [`GRANT OWNERSHIP` Snowflake documentation page](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/grant-ownership), and our grant ownership resource overview.
 *
 * > **Note** Manage grants on `HYBRID TABLE` by specifying `TABLE` or `TABLES` in `objectType` field. This applies to a single object, all objects, or future objects. This reflects the current behavior in Snowflake.
 *
 * > **Note** Changes introduced in [202501 Snowflake BCR Bundle](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_01/bcr-1870) alter how future ownership grant hierarchy works. After the change schema-level future ownership grant(s) will override those defined on the database-level. Previously, the database-level ones took the precedence.
 *
 * > **Warning** Be careful when using this resource on managed schema or any object within it, as in Snowflake managed schemas follow different ownership and privilege model. For more details, please visit [Schema documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-schema#optional-parameters) (scroll to `WITH MANAGED ACCESS` option).
 *
 * !> **Warning** Grant ownership resource still has some limitations. Delete operation is not implemented for onFuture grants (you have to remove the config and then revoke ownership grant on future X manually).
